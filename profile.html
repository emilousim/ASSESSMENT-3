        <p>Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work in a variety of environments which has led to me gaining a extremely useful set of workplace skills. My background is in the customer service industry; this has resulted in me learning many new things. In my opinon, my strongest set of skills consists of a couple different things: <ul>
            <li>    Excellent intpersonal skills</li>
            <li>    Team player, but equally capable of working individually</li>
            <li>    Performs well under stress</li>
            <li>    Aptitude for learning quickly</li>
            <li>    Positive attitude</li>
            <li>    Critical thinking skills</li>
        </ul>
       </p>
       <p>Outside of work, I like to think I have a pretty broad selection of interests and hobbies. Currently, the thing I enjoy most is music. I love music of all kinds. If it sounds good, regardless of genre, I love it. I also like to attend live concerts and shows as frequently as possible, which has been very little as of late due to COVID-19. In addition to music, I love being with my family (my partner, 4 cats, and 3 dogs), as well as putting together puzzles, and travelling. </p>
